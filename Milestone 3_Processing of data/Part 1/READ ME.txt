HOW TO GET TO CORRELATION ANALYSIS

STEP 1:
Combine 20 days stock data together into a single dataset

STEP 2:
Find out the missing values in the dataset

STEP 3:
Sort data by 'date'
Groupby data by 'name'
Calculate the percentage of stock price changed
Save the calculated values to a new variable 'change'
Save the data into a new dataset for the use of dimension reduction

STEP 4:
Filter each data with respect to its market
- 5 markets : main market, ace market, bond&loan, etf, warrants
- save it to different csv files

STEP 5:
Create pivot table for each of the sector in the dataset produced in STEP 4
- Index : Date
- Columns : Name
- Values : Change

STEP 6:
Rename some term to shorten it and use for naming 
- Warrants to W
- Ace Market to AM
- Main Market to MM
- Bond & Loan to BL
- Industrial Products & Services to IPS
- Consumer Products & Services to CPS
- Telecommunications & Media to TM
- Transportation & Logistics to TL
- Exchange Traded Fund to ETF
- Real Estate Investment Trusts to REIT
- Special Purpose Acquisition Company to SPAC
- Financial Services to FS
- Bond Islamic to BI
- Closed End Fund to CEF

Correlate between the percentage of stock price change of each company
- except 'date'
- set the decimal place to 5 decimal places

STEP 7:
Save all the correlation results into a single excel file with multiple sheets
- name the sheets with market and sector name so that it can be recognized easily

STEP 8:
Interpret the correlation results
- Values > 0.5 (dark blue)
	- means the stocks are highly positively correlated
- 0 < Values <= 0.5 (light blue)
	- means the stocks are positively correlated
- Values = 0 (yellow)
	- means no correlation between stocks
- -0.5 < Values < 0 (light red)
	- means the stocks are negatively correlated
- -1 < Values < -0.5 (dark red)
	- means the stocks are highly negatively correlated
- empty cell (light red without value)
	- means there are NaN in the percentage of stock price changed data
- Values = 1 (green)
